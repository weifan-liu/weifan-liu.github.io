Research Interests:
======
My research interests are in the fast algorithms and scientific computation of fluid dynamics problems that arise in biology and physics. I have done research in the development of numerical algorithms for bio-inspired fluid simulations, asymptotic analysis for thin liquid film equations, data-driven methods, and modeling for mathematical biology problems.

Education:
======
I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics from Duke University (2014-2019). Prior to that, I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematical Sciences from Worcester Polytechnic Institute (2010-2014).

Professional Experience:
======
I was a Philip T. Church postdoctooral fellow at Department of Mathematics of Syracuse University from 2019 to 2022.
